    <p>NORA.
        _[putting her hands over his mouth]_. Oh! don’t say such horrid things.</p>
        
        <p>HELMER.<br>
        Still, suppose that happened,—what then?</p>
        
        <p>NORA.<br>
        If that were to happen, I don’t suppose I should care whether I owed<br>
        money or not.</p>
        
        <p>HELMER.<br>
        Yes, but what about the people who had lent it?</p>
        
        <p>NORA.<br>
        They? Who would bother about them? I should not know who they were.</p>
        
        <p>HELMER.<br>
        That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I think about<br>
        that. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty about a<br>
        home life that depends on borrowing and debt. We two have kept bravely<br>
        on the straight road so far, and we will go on the same way for the<br>
        short time longer that there need be any struggle.</p>
        
        <p>NORA.<br>
        _[moving towards the stove]_. As you please, Torvald.</p>
