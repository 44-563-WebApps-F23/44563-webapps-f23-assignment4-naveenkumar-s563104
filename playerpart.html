            <p class="speech">Still, suppose that happened,—what then?</p>
        
        <p1 class="nora"><h5>NORA.</h5></p1>
            <p class="speech">If that were to happen, I don’t suppose I should care whether I owed<br>
        money or not.</p>

            <p class="speech">Yes, but what about the people who had lent it?</p>
        
        <p1 class="nora"><h5>NORA.</h5></p1>
            <p class="speech">They? Who would bother about them? I should not know who they were.</p>
        
        <p1 class="helmer"><h5>HELMER.</h5></p1>
            <p class="speech">That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I think about<br>
        that. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty about a<br>
        home life that depends on borrowing and debt. We two have kept bravely<br>
        on the straight road so far, and we will go on the same way for the<br>
        short time longer that there need be any struggle.</p>
