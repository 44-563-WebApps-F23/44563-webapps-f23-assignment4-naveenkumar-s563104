    <p>NORA.
        _[putting her hands over his mouth]_. Oh! don’t say such horrid things.
        
        HELMER.
        Still, suppose that happened,—what then?
        
        NORA.
        If that were to happen, I don’t suppose I should care whether I owed
        money or not.
        
        HELMER.
        Yes, but what about the people who had lent it?
        
        NORA.
        They? Who would bother about them? I should not know who they were.
        
        HELMER.
        That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I think about
        that. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty about a
        home life that depends on borrowing and debt. We two have kept bravely
        on the straight road so far, and we will go on the same way for the
        short time longer that there need be any struggle.
        
        NORA.
        _[moving towards the stove]_. As you please, Torvald.
